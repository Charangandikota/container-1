    <p>TITLE:"A NOVEL COMPACT DUALBAND INDIAN RUPEE SHAPED RE ANTENNA TOWARDS MOBILE APPLICATIONS".
        
    ABSTRACT:The rectangular antenna in form of dollor sysmbol fed by micro strip line is made up of fr4
         substracte a thickness of 1.6 mm and a relative permitivity of 4.4 the ground plane on the
         antenna is prinited. while containing two slots resulting antenna has been found suitable
         for WLAN.The proposed antenna presents the omni directional in plan E and bi directional radition in
         plane H. The above antenna is used for the WLAN technology. The dual band antennas
         can be useful for in many wireless application that include two different frequency bands
         for receiving and transmitting.
